Project overview-
 Organization OptiConnect Solutions:
       OptiConnect Solutions was a famous call center services provider company based out of technoville.
It was a renowned player in the customer service industry, providing top-notch support for a variety of products and services.  
Within the vast expanse of OptiConnect's customer service operations, the meticulous record-keeping system captured crucial details 
through fields such as Call Id, Date, Agent name, Department, Answered (Y/N), Resolved (Y/N), Speed of Answer, Average Talk Duration, 
and Satisfaction Rating.

The data spoke of a complex narrative, where agents strived to answer calls promptly, resolve issues efficiently, and leave customers satisfied.
The  organization found itself at the crossroads of optimizing its call center performance to ensure unparalleled customer experiences.

Amidst the sea of information, questions emerged: Were calls consistently answered in a timely manner? 
Did the agents successfully resolve customer issues?
How did the speed of answer and average talk duration impact customer satisfaction?
Were there patterns or trends hidden within the data that could unlock the key to achieving optimal call center performance?

As the call center management grappled with these questions, OptiConnect Solutions faced the challenge of enhancing operational efficiency
boosting agent productivity, and ultimately elevating customer satisfaction and hired you as a data analyst.
